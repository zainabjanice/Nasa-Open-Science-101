Welcome to my open notebook for the NASA Open Science 101 Curriculum. This project documents my journey in mastering Open Science principles, tools, and practices to build transparent, collaborative AI research.

## 🎯 Goal
To integrate open science workflows into my projects in AI, space medicine, and scientific innovation.

## 📚 Modules
- **Module 1: Ethos of Open Science**  
  My personal reflections and how open science can transform collaborative AI research.

- **Module 2: Open Tools & Resources**  
  Tools explored: Zenodo, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Binder.  
  I practiced reproducible pipelines for machine learning experiments.

- **Module 3: Open Data**  
  Sample use: Mars terrain dataset from NASA PDS. Cleaned, documented, and shared using FAIR principles.

- **Module 4: Open Code**  
  Published my speaker verification (GMM) code and added open license, instructions, and citations.

- **Module 5: Open Results**  
  Visualizations and reproducible metrics from my AI pipeline (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.)
